# Automation Runbook SSOT

- Added: OPS/RUNBOOK_AUTOMATION.md
- Purpose: single-page recovery and audit for the completed automation system
- Contents: invariants, architecture, health checks, emergency controls, playbooks, canary recipes

Done when: docs-only PR auto-merges and the runbook is on main.
